To talk about motivation for this study, Nonparental care arragement is very common and there is a need for providing high quality of care. 

States set minimum standards for child care facilities, and most of them are structural that are thought to be related to quality and safety. [Click]
<br>
<br>
We focus on staff to child ratios becasuse impact of staff/child ratio is ambiguous as they tend to have two potential opposesing forces on the market.

Setting higher staff to child ratio requires more staff per child, which means it leads to more employment; and more staff per child means higher service quality. 

But, increasing staff raises service cost and it is passed onto consumers, and  as it becomes less affordable, consumers will look for other althernatives and demand for care would fall along with the employment. 


The overall impact of these two opposing forces needs to be studied empirically.

so, based on newer data from 2011 to 2017, and we are implementing three different quasi-experimental designs. 

First, we use regression discontinuity design based on small geographic unit data within 10 miles of the border line. We have childcare provider’s exact location from Dun & Bradstreet, and estimate how market outcome changes as it goes from lower/stricter policy states. 
 
\\

Second, We use county-level data and examine the effect of changing ratio requirement using two-way fixed effects model with county and year fixed effects, which is close to the study by Hotz and Xiao.

\\
Third, we use state-year level data to implement synthetic control method. so for each treated state, we identified the specific year when the policy change occurred, and construct a “synthetic state” to compare if market outcomes have different trajectory between the treated and control state. 


---------------------

One concern with these two models is that there could be local economic shocks correlated with state changes in SCR. A different design focuses on contrasts across state borders.

 Variation in the policy variable (Staff to child ratio)

 <aside class="notes">
This graph shows the variation in staff to child ratio over time during the study window, there is a couple of states that experienced a decrease in the ratio ranging from 5% to 9% between 2011 to 14, few states saw  an increase in the ratio ranging 4% to 12% between 2014 and 2017.


---------------------------------

The ratio information comes from Child Care Licensing Programs and Policies Survey. They publish data on ratios for each state by child age group every three years, and we use data from 2011 to 2017.


Across the 6,504 county-years from 2,168 unique counties in the county-level analysis,
this raw SCR variable averages 0.12 (average regulation requires 0.12 staff per child or 8.33
children per staff) with a standard deviation of 0.026, a minimum of 0.0 (in state-years with
no SCR regulation) and a maximum of 0.167 (6 children per staff) in the most-stringent regime.


If the minimum is 1 staff per 4 children, the staff-child minimum ratio is 0.25. If there is no
minimum, the value is 0, corresponding to a possibly infinite number of children per staff. To
build a harmonized summary measure of SCR stringency for each state year that includes
information across age groups, we take a weighted average of group SCR using each age
group’s share of the 66 months of age before average age at kindergarten entry. Across all
states in all three calendar years, SCR policies are observed for 5 age points. We assume each
age-point policy applies for the following share of early childhood: 6-week SCR gets 12/66
months of weight, 18-month gets 24/66, 3-year gets 12/66, 4-year gets 12/66, and 5-year gets
6/66 months. For each state-year, we use the cross-age-point weighted average of these SCR
to a scalar measure SCR policy overall.

 This graph shows how the distribution of providers or employment differs near state borders with varying level of staff-child ratio.

The horizontal axis shows distance from the border, with negative values in the less-strict state and positive values in the stricter state. The vertical axis represents the share of providers at each distance.

Without regulatory differences, providers are evenly distributed across the border like in the Figure on top. If stricter regulation increase costs more than demand, supply shifts toward the less-strict side, as providers move to maximize profits like in the Figure at the bottom.


--------
This graph shows how the spatial distribution of provider establishments or employment around a state border might differ under two scenarios where a pair of bordering states have different CSR strictness in policy.

The horizontal axis is the distance to the border with negative numbers indicating distance into the less-strict state and positive ones into the more-strict state. 

The vertical axis is the share of local childcare establishments located at each distance from the border. If there is no regulatory differences, we would expect to see childcare providers uniformly distributed across the border, just like in figure (a) 

If SCR regulation drives down supply through increased costs more than it drives up demand through increased quality, then we would expect to see a pattern as in sub-figure (b), where some of the supply that would otherwise locate near the strict side of the border can boost profit by crossing the border.

This graph shows a map of the zones used in the discontinuity design analysis. We created zones that consists of partitions of areas that are adjecent to the state borders within 10 mile distance to the border line. 

Each colored area represents a zone extending 10 miles in each direction from the state border, with zones further subdivided by distance to the border.

--------
The Build Balanced Zones tool uses a genetic algorithm to create spatially contiguous zones in your study area based on criteria that you specify. You can create zones that contain an equal number of features, zones that are similar based on a set of attribute values, or both. There are also options to select zones with approximately equal areas, that are as compact as possible, and that maintain consistent summary statistics (such as averages and proportions) of other variables.

 County-year level analysis: Effect of child-staff ratio on number of establishment per family by employee size

 <aside class="notes">
Moving on to the resutls, The county panel analysis shows no overall effect of changes in SCR regulation on the
number of childcare establishments per family with any young children. The point
estimates are negative but not significant without controls with and without controls. 

when looking at the establishment by size of employees, establishments with larger size with 20 to 39 employees show negative and statistically significant effect. 

Traslating the coefficent in coulmn (11) says that one SD increase in the ratio induces 5% reduction in the total establishments , which is consistent with findings by Hotz and Xiao (2011) in that greater stringency of regulations reduces number of center-based providers.

----------------
Increasing required staff per child by 1 SD(like moving from
13 children allowed per staff to 10 allowed), induces 0.016(=0.026*0.645) reduction (3.1% of
the outcome mean). But the estimate is not significant at conventional levels. The point
estimates here agree with Hotz and Xiao (2011) but the estimate is imprecise. 
Looking at effects across establishment employment-size categories, none of the models including controls are statistically significant, except for establishments with larger size with 20 to 39 employees, where one SD increase in the ratio induces -0.026(=-1.126*0.026) reduction in the establishments which is approximately 5% of the total number of establishment per 100 families, which is consistent with findings by Hotz and Xiao (2011) in that greater
stringency of regulations reduces number of center-based providers.

 <aside class="notes">
The change in ratio doesn’t seem to have affect other outcome variables including number of total childcare employees, payroll per employee and staff turnover rate. The signs are negative but not statistically significant at the conventional level. 
---------------------------------  
A fall in payroll could be a compensating differential for an improved working condition of higher SCR. It could also just be a squeeze on workers by businesses facing tighter margins as regulations force increases in staffing quantity per child. We do not see strong evidence of effects on the number of employees per family with any young child (staffing intensity) nor staff turnover rate (proxy for low job quality).  Alternatively, providers may be cutting hourly wages and substituting towards workers with worse outside options.

 <aside class="notes">
Next, we repeat the analysis but splitting the sample of counties into terciles based on
each county’s average median income across years.  


This table shows that the decrease in the number of larger childcare establishments that has more than 20 and less than 99 employees tend to decrease as a result of stricter staff to child regulation, and this primarily occurs in low-income counties. Which suggests that stricter regulations may be driving out center-based establishments in
low-income neighborhoods.

For context, Hotz and Xiao (2011) reported a stronger negative effect on establishment counts in low-income communities.

But we found zones in bottom tercile of income category, the interaction term between treatment
and distance from the state border is negative and statistically significant for all outcomes, indicating that farther from the border, treated areas have relatively less establishment, employees and sales volume. 

In contrast, the bottom income tercile displays evidence of a significant positive effect of stricter SCR policies on the number of employees per family in column (4). which suggesting that stricter regulations may increase employment in the child care sector in lower-income regions. 
 
 -------------------------------

"Regarding the number of establishments in the child care sector from the Business Patterns data, it seems that most home-based providers are excluded, as the CBP does not include businesses without employees."

Regarding the number of establishments in the child care sector from the Business Patterns data, it seems that most home-based providers are excluded, as the CBP does not include businesses without employees. According to the CBP data, there were 4,296 child care service establishments in Minnesota in 2015, but in the data we used for the ECRQ paper, we identified 11,989 providers in MN, including approximately 10,094 home-based providers, 1,186 center-based providers, and 695 public providers. So, while the CBP data may not cover only center-based establishments, it likely includes a mix of home-based and center providers with employees. In DNB, we have 6800 child care providers and 16 % of them are home-based providers.

we find stricter child-to-staff ratio (SCR) regulations have no statistically significant impacts on market outcomes, but we find some evidence that modest reductions in medium-sized providers (20–39 employees), particularly in low-income areas. This seems to align with the one of the forces mentioned earlier, that stricter policy increases cost of service and leads to decline in the supply and demand for the service.  
 <br> <br>


Zone-level analysis finds that stricter regulation in areas within 10 miles of state borders increase childcare employment in lower-income areas. This seems to contradicting the finding from County-level analysis. so, we are trying to make sense out of the results.
 <br> <br>

Preliminary state-level results for Louisiana, show no clear impact of the policy change on child care market outcomes. 
 
 <br> <br>
So, Overall, we find very little evidence of the impact of staff-to-child ratios on market outcomes. We are working on refining the policy variables by identifying the exact year of these policy changes. and This will allow us to include more years in the data and increase the power of our estimation.
