To begin with the motivation for this study, Nonparental care arragement is very common and there is a need for providing high quality of care. 

so, states set minimum standards for child care facilities, and most of them are structural that are thought to be related to quality and safety. [Click]

 
<br>
<br>
Why is regulation important? Understanding the role of regulation in the market is crucial, as it may influence the supply and cost of care. There is growing interest in expanding child care through deregulation, and it is important to understand how regulation impacts the market to prevent any unintended negative effects from both regulation and deregulation.

<br>
<br>
In this study, we focus on staff to child ratios becasuse its impact is ambiguous as they tend to have two potential opposesing forces on the market.

First, and more intuitive force is that Setting higher staff to child ratio requires more staff per child, which means it leads to more employment; and more staff per child means higher service quality, which leads to higher demand for the care.

But, increasing staff raises service cost and it's passed onto consumers, and  as it becomes less affordable, consumers will look for other althernatives and demand for child care would fall along with the overall quantity in the market. 


so, the net impact of these two opposing forces needs to be studied empirically.

and There is relatively few studies that have examined the effects of the ratio on the child care market. There is a Hotz and Xiao paper published in 2011, and they found stricter staff to child ratios decrease number of child care center establishments, particularly in poor communities. but it uses data from 25 years ago, so we are re-examining using the newer data, and different methods.

--------------------------------
 who use restricted-access establishment-level panel data on child care centers from 1987, 1992 and 1997 in a model with state, time and establishment fixed effects. Their results show that stricter state regulation of staff-child ratios led to a decrease in the number of child care center establishments, particularly in areas with more poor families. Yet they also found evidence that stricter state regulation improved quality of care proxied by the share of child care centers with national accreditation, particularly in higher income areas

 <aside class="notes">
so, Using newer data from 2011 to 2017, we are implementing three different quasi-experimental designs.
<br>
<br>
First , We use county business pattern data and estimation is based on two-way fixed effects model with county and year fixed effects, which is close to the study by Hotz and Xiao in terms of method.
<br>
<br>

Second, we use regression discontinuity design based on small geographic unit data within 10 miles of the border line. We have childcare provider’s exact location from Dun & Bradstreet data, and estimate how market outcome changes as it goes from lower/stricter policy states. 
 <br>

<br>
Third, we use state-year level data to implement synthetic control method. so for each treated state, we identified the specific year when the policy change occurred, and construct a “synthetic state” to compare if market outcomes have different trajectory between the treated and the counterfactual. 
<br>
<br>

---------------------

One concern with these two models is that there could be local economic shocks correlated with state changes in SCR. A different design focuses on contrasts across state borders.

I will go over county-level analysis first, This balanced panel data includes 2,100 counties and we have 3 years of data from 2011 to 2017. The outcome variables includes, number of establishments, employees and payroll per employee from County Business Patterns (CBP) data, we also have staff turnover rates from the Census Quarterly Workforce Indicators data.
<br>
<br>
Staff-to-child ratio is a state-level variable, the mean across the county-year is 0.115, which is about 9 children per staff. We also include Demographic controls from American Community Survey.

County-year level analysis: Effect of child-staff ratio on N of employees, N of establishments, annual payroll per Employee, and staff turnover rate

 <aside class="notes">
Moving on to the results, Based on the two-way fixed effects model, the change in ratio doesn’t seem to have affect any observed outcomes. The signs are negative but not statistically significant at the conventional level.
<br>
<br>
---------------------------------  
A fall in payroll could be a compensating differential for an improved working condition of higher SCR. It could also just be a squeeze on workers by businesses facing tighter margins as regulations force increases in staffing quantity per child. We do not see strong evidence of effects on the number of employees per family with any young child (staffing intensity) nor staff turnover rate (proxy for low job quality).  Alternatively, providers may be cutting hourly wages and substituting towards workers with worse outside options.
----------------
Increasing required staff per child by 1 SD(like moving from
13 children allowed per staff to 10 allowed), induces 0.016(=0.026*0.645) reduction (3.1% of
the outcome mean). But the estimate is not significant at conventional levels. The point
estimates here agree with Hotz and Xiao (2011) but the estimate is imprecise. 
Looking at effects across establishment employment-size categories, none of the models including controls are statistically significant, except for establishments with larger size with 20 to 39 employees, where one SD increase in the ratio induces -0.026(=-1.126*0.026) reduction in the establishments which is approximately 5% of the total number of establishment per 100 families, which is consistent with findings by Hotz and Xiao (2011) in that greater
stringency of regulations reduces number of center-based providers.

Next, we repeat the analysis but splitting the sample of counties into terciles based on
each county’s average median income across years.  
<br>
<br>
Theere is no clear pattern here, the signs and magnitude are negative in the middle and bottom terciles communities, but it is not statistically significant at the converntional level. So, our county-level results indicates that there is no evidence of impact of the ratio on the market. 
<br>
<br>
--------------------------
For context, Hotz and Xiao (2011) reported a stronger negative effect on establishment counts in low-income communities.

This map shows the unit of analysis we are using in the discontinuity design analysis. We created zones using a tool from GIS software that create spatially contiguous  zones based on multiple criteria including number of zones, size of the area. 

<br>
<br>
Zones are adjecent to the state borders within 10 mile distance to the border line and it is shown by the colored area on the map. Each state-zone is further partitioned into 5 subzones based on distance to the border. The map on the right shows the providers between Missouri and Kansas in the Kansas City area as an example and We aggregate the provider location-level data from dunn and bradstreet data for each zones for analysis. 
 
<br>
<br>
--------
The Build Balanced Zones tool uses a genetic algorithm to create spatially contiguous zones in your study area based on criteria that you specify. You can create zones that contain an equal number of features, zones that are similar based on a set of attribute values, or both. There are also options to select zones with approximately equal areas, that are as compact as possible, and that maintain consistent summary statistics (such as averages and proportions) of other variables.

We break down the results by income terciles. We found no clear pattern in the size or direction of the effect on the outcome variables. 
<br>
<br>
We can see that the bottom income tercile displays evidence of a significant positive effect of stricter regulation on the number of employees in column (2). which suggesting positive association between stricter regulations and number of  employment in the child care sector in lower-income communities. We are not sure how to best interpret this result, but this aligns with the first force mentioned earlier that increasing staff to child ratio leads to more employment in the sector.
 
 -------------------------------

"Regarding the number of establishments in the child care sector from the Business Patterns data, it seems that most home-based providers are excluded, as the CBP does not include businesses without employees."

Regarding the number of establishments in the child care sector from the Business Patterns data, it seems that most home-based providers are excluded, as the CBP does not include businesses without employees. According to the CBP data, there were 4,296 child care service establishments in Minnesota in 2015, but in the data we used for the ECRQ paper, we identified 11,989 providers in MN, including approximately 10,094 home-based providers, 1,186 center-based providers, and 695 public providers. So, while the CBP data may not cover only center-based establishments, it likely includes a mix of home-based and center providers with employees. In DNB, we have 6800 child care providers and 16 % of them are home-based providers.

The effect on number of providers is shown on the left and number of employees per family on the right, showing little evidence that stricter regulations significantly impact childcare quantity as a whole.

Identifying the exact year of policy changes necessitates reviewing state administrative codes or statutes, which is a time-intensive process. For illustration, we present results for Louisiana, where a policy change occurred in 2015.

The signs of the estimates generally align  with findings from Hotz and Xiao, indicating that stricter policies increase service costs and reduce demand

Going forward, plan to add more years of data to increase power (requires identifying exact year of policy change)

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
So to summarize what we found so far, this table summarizes our findings and Hotz and Xias findings as a reference.
<br><br>
We find stricter child-to-staff ratio (SCR) regulations have no impacts on overall market outcomes using data from 2011-17, although we find some evidence that modest reductions in the number of providers in low-income areas. The signs of the estimates mostly align with what was found in Hotz and Xiao, and seems to align with one of the forces mentioned earlier, that stricter policy increases cost of service and leads to a decline in the supply and demand for the service.  
<br><br>

In RDD analysis, we find that stricter regulation in areas within 10 miles of state borders increase childcare employment in lower-income areas, which seem to align with the 1st force that more stringent regulation increase number of staffs per child.
<br><br>

So, Overall, we find limited evidence of the impact of staff-to-child ratios on market outcomes. We are working on refining the policy variables by identifying the exact year of these policy changes. This will allow us to include more years in the data and increase the power of our estimation. Thank you.

 <aside class="notes">
Here you can see the variation in staff to child ratio over time during the study window, there is a couple of states that experienced a decrease in the ratio between 2011 to 14, and few states saw an increase in the ratio up to 13 percent between 2014 and 17. But most states have no change in the ratio during the study window.
<br>
<br>

---------------------------------

The ratio information comes from Child Care Licensing Programs and Policies Survey. They publish data on ratios for each state by child age group every three years, and we use data from 2011 to 2017.


Across the 6,504 county-years from 2,168 unique counties in the county-level analysis,
this raw SCR variable averages 0.12 (average regulation requires 0.12 staff per child or 8.33
children per staff) with a standard deviation of 0.026, a minimum of 0.0 (in state-years with
no SCR regulation) and a maximum of 0.167 (6 children per staff) in the most-stringent regime.


If the minimum is 1 staff per 4 children, the staff-child minimum ratio is 0.25. If there is no
minimum, the value is 0, corresponding to a possibly infinite number of children per staff. To
build a harmonized summary measure of SCR stringency for each state year that includes
information across age groups, we take a weighted average of group SCR using each age
group’s share of the 66 months of age before average age at kindergarten entry. Across all
states in all three calendar years, SCR policies are observed for 5 age points. We assume each
age-point policy applies for the following share of early childhood: 6-week SCR gets 12/66
months of weight, 18-month gets 24/66, 3-year gets 12/66, 4-year gets 12/66, and 5-year gets
6/66 months. For each state-year, we use the cross-age-point weighted average of these SCR
to a scalar measure SCR policy overall.

 Appendix: Hypothetical spatial distributions of providers near state border <br> <font size="4">by effect of state

 <aside class="notes">
 This graph shows how the distribution of providers differs near state borders with varying level of staff-child ratio.
<br>
<br>
The x-axis is the distance from the border, with negative values in the less-strict state and positive values in the stricter state. The vertical axis is the share of providers at each distance.
<br>
<br>
so the figure on top assumes no differences in regulation, and so providers are evenly distributed across the border. Figure at the bottom assumes there exists difference in the regulation between states, and if stricter regulation increase costs more than demand, supply shifts toward the less-strict side, as providers move to maximize profits.
<br>
<br>

--------
This graph shows how the spatial distribution of provider establishments or employment around a state border might differ under two scenarios where a pair of bordering states have different CSR strictness in policy.

The horizontal axis is the distance to the border with negative numbers indicating distance into the less-strict state and positive ones into the more-strict state. 

The vertical axis is the share of local childcare establishments located at each distance from the border. If there is no regulatory differences, we would expect to see childcare providers uniformly distributed across the border, just like in figure (a) 

If SCR regulation drives down supply through increased costs more than it drives up demand through increased quality, then we would expect to see a pattern as in sub-figure (b), where some of the supply that would otherwise locate near the strict side of the border can boost profit by crossing the border.
